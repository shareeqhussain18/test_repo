# House Price Prediction – Bangalore

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using machine learning.

## Objective
Build a regression model to estimate house prices based on:
- Total square feet
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of bathrooms
- Location

## Approach
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Outlier removal using domain logic
- Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression
- Cross-validation for stability
- Error analysis by price range

## Results
- Achieved ~80% R² with stable cross-validation
- Model performs best for mid-range properties
- Higher error observed for luxury properties due to limited data

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end regression workflow with proper evaluation and error analysis.
